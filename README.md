# Physical_activities_Habit_Tracker
## Overview
Recently, I have decided to keep on fit for my healthcare, but in a statistical way, so I've thought of a programme which can help me to track my physical activities and tell when was the last time I exercised?, how much I did? etc. Because I am someone who doesn't love empty squares, each time I get motivated to fill the pixel with the maximum quantity, so I think this is a motivating way to carry on and achieve my goal.                                                                                   Beside that you learn more by practicing (python in my case). Actually, this project require having a bit of knowledge on APIs, it calls as well advanced authentication requests like: 
- requests.get()                        
- requests.post()                                              
- requests.put() (to update)
- requests.delete() (juste to delete a tracking graph, not in our case).
For the moment I have created a tracking graph for my jogging habit and how much calories I burn, with time I will add probably others habit for example reading, coding etc, so this programme is so helpful to track your habit easily (once your graph is created it becomes handy forever).
